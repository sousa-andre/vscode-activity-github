# VSCode Activity

Have you ever wanted to share what you're building with others? No? Me neither but it looks fun!

### Installation

Get the extension on [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sousa-andre.vscode-activity-github) or search by "VSCode Activity on Github" on your editor extensions.

### Configuration

In order to get the extension to work you need to [create an personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the "user" permission and save it with the below setting and you're good to go!

```json
{
    "activityGithub.auth.accessToken": "YOUR_TOKEN"
}
```
